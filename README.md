# Monty-Hall-Proof
 A mathematical proof that you should always swap when you are presented with blind options and then shown one incorrect option after you have made your initial choice.

As is demonstrated in this program, there is almost always a much higher success rate when swapping after some of the incorrect doors are revealed than there is when you do not swap your selection.
